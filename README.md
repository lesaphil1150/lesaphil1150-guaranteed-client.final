guaranteed.

guaranteed. is an warranty and claim tracking site. After owning a house, I realized the increasing amount of paperwork I have to keep track of when it come to storing warranty and claim information for different appliances (even my cats water fountain came with a warranty!). I currently have a folder about 6 inches thick! Creating an online app to store different information regarding warranties/claims will make life a little easier!

About the Project
For this project, we were required to use React (Class Components). We were also required to include user roles, including an admin role. The admin role is allowed to view all posts, edit, and delete. I included Cloudinary to upload images of receipts for tracking purposes.

We were also tasked with using a different styling library. This project was made using reactstrap.
